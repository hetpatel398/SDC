# Self-driving car simulation
**Final year project by Excelsiors**

In the modern era, with the emergence of Technologies like Artificial
Intelligence and Machine Learning great results have been achieved in
different areas, among them one is ‘Automation of Vehicles’.
Nowadays automobiles are focused to be automated to give human driver
relaxed driving experience .Therefore using one of Deep Learning model
we are building simulation for self-driving car. With this simulation one
can get the flavor of real-time implementation of Self Driving Car.
Currently Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence are showing the way
and also provides the tools to implement such ideas.Such tools are often
used to implement innovation for the greater good.
Therefore the main idea of our project is to use such great technologies
To improve the driving experience of users.As we know Cars are main
source of transportation so we have decided to contribute towards the ‘Self
Driving Car’ which is great research area that has shown great promise in
future times to improve driving abilities of car in future.

**Python Libraries Required**
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Pillow

**Hardware Required**
* Preferable to have a GPU but we didn't have a GPU so we mainly trained it on Google Colab and Intel DevCloud

**How to Train and Run**

`python model.py` <----To Train

`python drive.py model.h` <-----To run using saved model model.h
